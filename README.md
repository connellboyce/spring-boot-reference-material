### Spring vs. Spring Boot
- Spring applications take time to get up and running whereas Spring Boot applications have much faster startup times.
- Spring "manages lifecycle of Java" while Spring Boot doesn't need to have a configured data source.
  - Spring Boot's auto-configuration measures are the reason why!
- Spring has a "dependency injection framework" but Spring Boot has pre-configured technology and frameworks.
- Spring Boot allows us to create a web application which can simply be run or executed. It is less complex than Spring.
